              <h3>COOKIES</h3>
              <p>
              To improve the responsiveness of the sites for our users, we may use "cookies", or similar electronic tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique, random number as a User Identification (User ID) to understand the user's individual interests using the Identified Computer. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we will have no way of knowing who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply. A cookie cannot read data off your hard drive. Our advertisers may also assign their own cookies to your browser (if you click on their ads), a process that we do not control.&nbsp;   </p>
              <p>
                Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP address, when you visit our site. (Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the web pages you view.) Your IP address does not identify you personally.

                </p>
  
              <h3>LINKS TO THE OTHER SITES </h3>

              </p>
  
              <h3>INFORMATION SHARING </h3>

                <p>

The database is stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is password-protected and is strictly limited.
